"""Temp-directory housekeeping for the MAGI orchestrator.

Extracted from ``run_magi.py`` so the orchestrator file no longer has to
hold the LRU + symlink-traversal + mtime-tie-break rules in the same
mental model as subprocess and display concerns. The helpers here are
pure filesystem manipulation — no asyncio, no subprocesses, no CLI —
and can be unit-tested independently of the orchestrator wiring.

Public contract:

* :data:`MAGI_DIR_PREFIX` is the single source of truth for the
  ``magi-run-*`` directory naming convention; both cleanup and creation
  must agree on it.
* :func:`cleanup_old_runs` is the LRU entry point. It is deliberately
  total (never raises on scan/stat errors, only on programmer errors)
  so the orchestrator can call it unconditionally.
* :func:`create_output_dir` is the counterpart that honors the same
  prefix when generating a temp dir.

``_scan_magi_dirs``, ``_safe_temp_prefix`` and ``_safe_rmtree_under``
are internal helpers exposed with leading underscores — they are only
module-public for the regression suite that drills into specific TOCTOU
and mtime tie-break behaviors.

    Scans the system temp directory for directories matching the
